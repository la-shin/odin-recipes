The Odin Project - Project 1

## Project Description
**Odin Recipes** is my first HTML project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a simple website containing a collection of recipes. Each recipe page includes basic information about the dish, such as the title, a list of ingredients, and preparation instructions.

## What does this project demonstrate?
Through this project, I demonstrate:
- Understanding of basic HTML structure (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- Using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to organize content.
- Writing paragraphs (`<p>`) and enhancing text with `<strong>` and `<em>`.
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages using `<a>` tags.
- Using lists (`<ul>` and `<ol>`) to organize information.
- Working with basic elements such as images (`<img>`) and comments (`<!-- -->`).

## What have I learned?
By working on this project, I have learned:
1. How to properly create the basic structure of an HTML document.
2. How to use different HTML elements to represent content.
3. How to link different pages together into a cohesive website.
4. How to organize and format text and information effectively.

## Conclusion
**Odin Recipes** has been an excellent way to gain hands-on experience in writing HTML and organizing content on a website. Iâ€™m excited to move forward and add styles using CSS in the next projects!

    <h2>Let's Get Cooking</h2>

    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Zucchini</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Yellow summer squash</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Chinese or Japanese eggplant</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Roma tomatoes</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tomato purée</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep the vegetables</strong>. Once trimmed, the zucchini, summer squash, eggplant, and Roma tomatoes should all be cut into 1/16-inch-thick rounds. If you have a mandoline, this is a great time to get it out — it’s perfect for getting thin, even slices of zucchini and summer squash. You will need to use a knife for the eggplant and tomatoes, as their flesh is too soft for the mandoline. </li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong>. Sauté the onion and bell pepper until soft, stir in the garlic and herbs, then add the tomato purée and simmer until slightly thickened. Stir in red wine vinegar and spread the sauce into an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange the vegetables</strong>. Starting at the outer edge of the skillet and working inward, arrange the vegetable rounds in concentric circles, alternating the vegetables and overlapping the slices so that just a little bit of each slice is visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover and bake</strong>. Drizzle with olive oil and season. Cover the skillet and bake until the vegetables are softened and have released their liquid, but are not browned around the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the ratatouille</strong>. Uncover and let the ratatouille rest for five minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
